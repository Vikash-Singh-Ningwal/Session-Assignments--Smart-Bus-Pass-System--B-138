# 🚌 Smart Bus Pass System (Cloud-Based)

Project Overview
The Smart Bus Pass System (SBPS) is a modern, serverless application designed to digitize public transport passes, eliminating the need for physical cards and enhancing security against fraud. The system achieves real-time validation by linking unique passenger QR codes directly to the cloud database.This project was developed by Vikash Singh Ningwal as part of the Information Technology Engineering program at Shri G. S. Institute of Technology & Science (SGSITS).

✨ Key Features
### 100% Digital Pass Management  
Eliminates physical bus passes and paper tickets, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

### Real-Time QR Validation  
- Each user receives a **unique QR code** linked to the cloud database.  
- Conductors use the web module (`verify.html`) to scan and validate the pass.  
- Validity status is fetched and verified in **under 2 seconds**, helping prevent fraud instantly.

### Flexible Pass Options  
Users can purchase different duration-based passes:
- **Daily Pass – ₹50**
- **Weekly Pass – ₹199**
- **Monthly Pass – ₹699**

### Secure Payment Integration  
All pass purchases are processed using the **Razorpay API**, ensuring secure, encrypted, and seamless transactions.

### Dual Identity System  
Each user receives:
- A **User ID**  
- A **Wallet ID**  
This dual-identifier system enhances security and ensures better account/pass management on the backend.
